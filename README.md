## ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥To-do List
âœ… Choose a baseline for Modality Evaluation.

â¬œ Write a script to evaluate the `quality' of each modality and present the results via Radar charts.


## ðŸŒ‹ Modality Evaluation
We simply adopt the SVM as a baseline to evaluate the contribution of each modality for the classification task.
